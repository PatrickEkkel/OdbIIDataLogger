AT+ORGL (Set to original)
AT+NAME=ODBRDR
AT+ROLE=1 (Set to Master)
AT+CMODE=0 (Set connect to a specific address)
AT+PSWD=0000
AT+BIND=f859,71,3efe3a
AT+INIT (Need to connect)
AT+PAIR=f859,71,3efe3a,20 (,20 means 20 second timeout)
AT+LINK=f859,71,3efe3a


Useful info on how to setup serial port on linux for bluetooth SPP profile
http://www.userk.co.uk/arduino-bluetooth-linux/


as root run following commands

rfcomm bind 0 20:19:09:26:03:28 1

if busy then run (rfcomm release 0)
configure minicom with /dev/rfcomm0
sudo minicom -s -c on



connection the emulator to the bluetooth interface requires socat
run following command to relay bluetooth arduino stuff to elm emulator
socat /dev/rfcomm0,raw,echo=0 /dev/pts/1,raw,echo=0

run tio with -l option so we can sniff the serial connection and pass it to test_connection.py

tio -l /tmp/bluetooth_comms /dev/rfcomm0

Running the emulator so we have something to connect to.
